create a prepared statement called GetOrderDetail.

It will also help to secure the database from SQL injections.
The prepared statement should accept one input argument, the CustomerID value, from a variable.
The statement should return the OrderID from the Orders table, the Quantity of all items from the orderlines table by OrderID, and the total cost from the Orders table.â€¯
Once you create the prepared statement, you can create a variable called id and assign it a value of a customerid.
